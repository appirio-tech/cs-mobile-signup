    CloudSpokes was created as an independent crowdsourcing development community and marketplace that matches companies who need cloud development work with a worldwide community of cloud experts. The focus for CloudSpokes is solely on using public cloud platforms to build and deliver enterprise-class solutions.

<p>
    The flexibility of public cloud platforms has created a unique point where, for the first time, dramatic innovation can occur with both the underlying technology model and how results are delivered to businesses. For developers this creates a market for their talents, lets them develop new skills with real world assignments and transition their careers to the cloud, learn from the work of others, and establish their street cred as a skilled practitioner in the art and science of cloud development.

<p>
    Companies who need cloud development work can sponsor a challenge on CloudSpokes, giving developers a way to earn cash rewards, test and prove their skills for badges and other recognition. Challenges appear on a list visible to all developer members, along with the award amount and pre-defined success criteria so all participants are aware of how they’ll be judged. Submissions are scored by a peer review board and awarded to the best submission. Those participating in the challenge can then see other submissions and learn from their peers. The developer members’ public profile is updated to include challenge history, recommendations, and badges to build their profile inside the community and among potential employers.
